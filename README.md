# Student-Management-System_-Bash-Scripting-
You are a Systen Admin who has to create a school classroom system in the Linux Operating System. There are three types of users: root, teachers and students. Only the root (Admin) user can add users to the system.

Using bash scripting,
• Create a directory structure where there are multiple directories which
represent different classes. There should be multiple directories within a
class directory which represent marks of the students, notices, and
attendances.
• Set user permissions in such a way that students and the class teacher of
a class do not have access to another class directory. Root has
permissions to every path and should be able to send notice to every
class.
• Class teacher has the access to write into the class directory and to set
necessary permissions.
• A notice in the notice directory must have view access only to the
students of the class and not the edit access. Similarly, a mark sheet of a
student can be viewed only by that student and not others. You may add
any feature. For creativity, sky's the limit.
